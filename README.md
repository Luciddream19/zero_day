# zero_day
This project is on learning to use the git using command line editor Emacs on a linux OS
An account is first created on their website> github.com
Followed by installing git on your computer, if it's not done yet by using Terminal or any command line editor like Emacs by following the steps below:
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get upgrade
  $ sudo apt-get install git
  
Then you configure your basic info(name, email), still on the Terminal:(replacing the username and email here with yours)
  $ git config --global user.name "Newman Eddie"
  $ git config --global user.email "neweddie@yahoo.com"

At last our account has been finally setup

Now lets post our first repository on git

    Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
        Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
        Public repo: zero_day
        No README, .gitignore, or license

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

    Navigate to your home directory. Tips
    Create a directory zero_day. Tips
    Navigate to this new directory. Tips
    Initialize git and add the remote origin
    Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
    Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server).

Good job! ....
